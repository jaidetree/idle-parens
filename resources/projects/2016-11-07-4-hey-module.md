# <i class="fa fa-trophy icon"></i> Goal

After getting into functional programming I found myself having a hard time working with node&rsquo;s exports. Since I was mostly exporting pure functions it was a bit harder to mock side-effects compared to my OOP background of temporarily overriding a method or property. I wanted a way to manage exports more simply and make it easy to stub them out for unit tests.

## <i class="fa fa-list-ol icon"></i> Process
1. Started by writing out ideal interface code instead of implementation
2. Ran it by coworkers to collect feedback on syntax and if the project is a good idea
3. Implemented the library in node.js using now native ES2015 features
4. Wrote unit tests

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb icon"></i> Discoveries
- Learned the internals of node&rsquo;s require system
- Gained experience working with pure functions
- Gained better understanding of trade-offs focusing on functional-programming in node.
